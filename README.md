Cascade
-------

Cascade is a neuroscience analysis pipeline for my projects in the [Andermann lab](https://www.andermannlab.com). A large focus of my work is using demensionality reduction techniques such as Tensor Component Analysis (TCA) to explore association learning in large population of neurons in the visual system. For a great TCA implementation in Python see [Tensortools](https://github.com/ahwillia/tensortools).

These scripts rely heavily on data structures and code used and created by members of the Andermann lab.
